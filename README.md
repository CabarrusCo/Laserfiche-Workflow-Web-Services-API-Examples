### About Laserfiche Workflow Web Services

The Laserfiche Workflow Web Services API allows you to run and call Workflow from any application, Web or otherwise. The problem is there is hardly any documentation out there for the Workflow Web Services, and the documentation that is out there is mainly written around .NET technologies.

In this repository, we provide examples in

+ PHP
+ Python
+ Javascript to PHP
+ Javascript to a Python Webhook

Each example will be a seperate directory and each directory will have it's own README.md file.

### Examples we would love to see added

+ Rust
+ Golang
