### About Laserfiche Workflow Web Services
---

The Laserfiche Workflow Web Services API allows you to run and call Workflow from any application, Web or otherwise. The problem is barely any documentation exists for the Workflow Web Services API, and the documentation that is out there is mainly written around .NET technologies.

In this repository, we provide examples in

+ PHP
+ Python
+ Javascript to PHP
+ Go

All these example are Windows Test Server to Windows Test Server only. Other special considerations may have to be made depending on.

+ What type of Auth system you use for the Workflow Web Services(If Any). We use NTLM auth in these examples. So these examples have to be tweaked if using a different auth method.
+ Restructuring certain aspects of cURL in certain examples.


Each example will be a separate directory and each directory will have it's own README.md file.
